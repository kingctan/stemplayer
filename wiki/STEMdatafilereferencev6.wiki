<br>
Because the files are in XML grammar and file format, tag names are casesensitive
and must appear exactly as shown here: <br>

==<stem>===
Syntax
{{{
<stem>
</stem>
}}}

==Description==
This is the root element; all other elements must be contained inside it.

==<space>==
Syntax
{{{
<space>
  <background src="media/foyer.swf" x="0" y="0"> </background>
</space>
}}}

==Description==
The space element specifies where the interaction occurs. In a future version, this
element might be used to define rooms and other spaces.

==Children==
<background>
=<background>=
Syntax
{{{
<space>
 <background src="media/foyer.swf" x="0" y="0"> </background>
</space>
}}}

==Description==
The background element specifies the background image or media for the
interaction. Often, this is used to place an image of a room or other space in the
background of an interaction.

==Attributes==
*src Is the relative path for the background. This path is relative to the stem.swf file,
not the stem.xml file in the data folder. The file can be in any image format that
Flash supports, e.g. .swf, .jpg, .png. Because .swf files can be used, animation,
sound and other interactions can be added to the background.
â€¢
==Attributes==
*x The x position of the background. This is normally set to 0.
*y The y position of the background. This is normally set to 0.
