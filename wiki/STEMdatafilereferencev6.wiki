<br>
Because the files are in XML grammar and file format, tag names are casesensitive
and must appear exactly as shown here: <br>

<h1 id="stem">`<stem>`</h1>
Syntax
{{{
<stem>
</stem>
}}}
{anchor:myAnchor}
<br>
[anchor:myAnchor]
==Description==
This is the root element; all other elements must be contained inside it.

<h1 id="space">`<space>`</h1>
Syntax
{{{
<space>
  <background src="media/foyer.swf" x="0" y="0"> </background>
</space>
}}}

==Description==
The *space* element specifies where the interaction occurs. In a future version, this
element might be used to define rooms and other spaces.

==Children==
<a href="#background">`<background>`</a>
<h1 id="background">`<background>`</h1>
Syntax
{{{
<space>
 <background src="media/foyer.swf" x="0" y="0"> </background>
</space>
}}}

==Description==
The *background* element specifies the background image or media for the
interaction. Often, this is used to place an image of a room or other space in the
background of an interaction.

==Attributes==
<li> *src* Is the relative path for the background. This path is relative to the stem.swf file,
not the stem.xml file in the data folder. The file can be in any image format that
Flash supports, e.g. .swf, .jpg, .png. Because .swf files can be used, animation,
sound and other interactions can be added to the background.</li><br>

==Attributes==
<ul>
<li> *x* The x position of the background. This is normally set to 0.</li>
<li> *y* The y position of the background. This is normally set to 0.</li>
</ul>

==Parent==
<a href="#space">`<space>`</a>
<h1 id="messages">`<messages>`</h1>
Syntax
{{{
<messages>
  <padding x="10"></padding>
  <finalscore x="420" y="50" displayduring="yes">Score</finalscore>
  <finalfactors display="no"></finalfactors>
</messages>
}}}
==Description==
The *message* element contains the other elements that control the scoring and
feedback systems of STEM.

==Children==
<a href="#padding">`<padding>`</a><br>
<a href="#finalscore">`<finalscore>`</a><br>
<a href="#finalfactors">`<finalfactors>`</a><br>
<h1 id="padding">`<padding>`</h1>
Syntax
{{{
<messages>
  <padding x="10"></padding>
  <finalscore x="420" y="50" displayduring="yes">Score</finalscore>
  <finalfactors display="no"></finalfactors>
</messages>
}}}
==Description==
The *padding* element controls how much visual space there is between each of the
parts in final the feedback display, e.g. the bar charts show the scores. These
elements are stacked vertically, and the padding element only controls the padding
between the vertical elements.

==Attributes==
<li>*x* The amount of vertical padding between parts in the message box. This is normally set to 10.</li>

==Parent==
<a href="#messages">`<messages>`</a>
<h1 id="finalscore">`<finalscore>`</h1>
Syntax
{{{
<messages>
  <padding x="10"></padding>
  <finalscore x="420" y="50" displayduring="yes">Score</finalscore>
  <finalfactors display="no"></finalfactors>
</messages>
}}}
==Description==
The *finalscore* element controls the visual position of the score message, when the
messages are shown and what the score is labelled.

==Example==
{{{
<finalscore x="420" y="50" displayduring="yes">Progress</finalscore>
}}}
In this example, the score is shown in the top right hand corner with the word
progress showing during the whole interaction.

==Example==
{{{
<finalscore x="420" y="50" displayduring="no">Score</finalscore>
}}}
The score is shown in the top right hand corner only when the end branch is
chosen by the user and the word *Score* is used in the label.

==Attributes==
<ul>
<li>*x* The x position of the score.</li>
<li>*y* The y position of the score.</li>
<li>*displayduring*. This can be set to yes or no. If you only want the score to show at
the end, it should be set to *displayduring=no*.</li>
</ul>

==Parent==
<a href="messages">`<messages>`</a>
<h1 id="finalfactors">`<finalfactors>`</h1>
Syntax
{{{
<messages>
  <padding x="10"></padding>
  <finalscore x="420" y="50" displayduring="yes">Score</finalscore>
  <finalfactors display="no"></finalfactors>
</messages>
}}}
==Description==
The *finalfactors* element controls if feedback is given on how the user's choices performed against each of the factors that are defined. STEM will create simple bar graphs for each of these factors, at the end of the interaction. There is more about the factors feature of STEM below.

==Attributes==
<li> *display* This can be set to yes or no. If you only want the score to show at the
end, it should be set to *displayduring=no*.</li>

==Parent==
<a href="#messages">`<messages>`</a>
<h1 id="factors">`<factors>`</h1>
Syntax
{{{
<factors>
  <factor>Customer Service</factor>
  <factor>Technical</factor>
</factors>
}}}
==Description==
The *factors* element contains other elements that define how the scoring system
works. Each choice a user makes has a score for each of the factors. This means that they might be able to make a choice that has a high score for customer service but is not technically correct. In that case, the score for the customer service factor would go up and the technical factor score would go down. The overall score is a combination of all the scores from all the factors. The report shown at the end shows how the user got on against factors. Every choice needs to be rated for all the factors.<br>
<br>
There are no limits to the amount of factors, but 3 seems to be a good amount to work with.

==Children==
<a href="#factor">`<factor>`</a>
<h1 id="factor">`<factor>`</h1>
Syntax
{{{
  <factor>Technical</factor>
}}}
==Description==
The *factor* element simply contains the name of each of scoring factor. For more about factors see <a href="#factors">'factors'</a> above.

==Parent==
<a href="#factors">`<factors>`</a>
<h1 id="reports">`<reports>`</h1>
Syntax
{{{
<reports>
  <report></report>
</reports>
}}}
==Description==
The *reports* element contains the report elements that define how the score is reported at the end.


==Children==
<a href="#report">`<report></a>
<h1 id="report">`<report>`</h1>
Syntax
{{{
<reports>
  <report>scorm</report>
</reports>
}}}
==Description==
The *report* specifics how the score is reported. The default value is blank, and the score is only shown to the user.
<br>
==Possible values==
*scorm* - When this is set, the following is reported to the Learning Management System via SCORM:
<ul>
<li> The total final score.</li>
<li> The score for each of the factors.</li>
<li> The choices the users made.</li>
</ul>
For the SCORM reporting to work, the SCORM_API_wrapper.js needs to be
included in the html. There is an example of how these dependencies work together in main.scorm.html.
<br><br>
This hasn't been extensively tested in multiple Learning Management Systems.<br>
The reports element is also at the end of the setup section of the xml file.

==Children==
<a href="#reports">`<reports>`</a>
<h1 id="interaction">`<interaction>`</h1>
Syntax
{{{
<interaction>
</interaction>
}}}
==Description==
The *interaction* element is a container element for the main elements that define the branches and choices. At the moment, STEM is set up for only one interaction element per XML file; in the future it may support multiple interactive elements. The first two children elements *name* and *visual* are setup elements.
