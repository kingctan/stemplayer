Stem is a flash system that allows anyone to build complex branching interactions. With Stem, you can develop interactive digital characters, simulate conversations and build rich scenario-based learning experiences.  These types of interactions are great when a learner needs to practice decision-making in a safe environment, and learn about cause and effect, and is perfect for content that needs to be learnt by experience.


Some of features of the system are:

  * Scoring is based on a number of factors/variables. Scores can be displayed during game play or at the end.
  * Scores can be sent back to Learning Management System(LMS) using SCORM 1.2
  * All aspects can be customised, eg, new images can be added and the position of elements can be changed.
  * When the user makes a choice feedback, help can be provided.
  * It's flash-based so 99.3 % of users can access and use it.
  * Educators can build interaction by editing an XML file.
  * Actionscript developers can expand and customize the code and use the interaction in other projects

**In the future a web system for authoring the xml files is planned.**

Stem is a [Sprout Labs](http://www.sproutlabs.com.au) project.
